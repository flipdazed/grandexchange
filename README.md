I used an updated version of this code to pull Runescape GrandExchange price data for
quant trading strategies.

I no longer actively play the game but I found this old version on an old laptop and thought
it might be interesting for someone to use.

I strongly suggest the following improvements:

- Pull the `JSON` item list programmatically
- Pull for a specific item
